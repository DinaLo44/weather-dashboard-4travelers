# Description
This application consists in displaying the weather so that travelers can take better decisions when plenning their trips. 

# Usage
When a user inputs a city name, the weather for the current day and 5-day forecast is displayed.
After refreshing the page a button is created for the previous searched city so that if the user wants to go back and check the 5-day forecast, by clicking the button with that specific city name, the user will be able to see the information. 

# Technologies
I used an API key from the openweathermap.org website. I used local storage to display the previously searched cities.
